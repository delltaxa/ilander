# ilander - v1.0.0.0

Hello, I'm learning python and I was bored so I've created an
reverse-shell Manager called 'iLander'

# What is it

iLander is a tool which you can use to Manage multiple shells
(not at once (but will be added soon))

# What can you do

you can scan (display) all the incomming connections via the
display command.

example:

after you display all the incomming connections, you can 
connect to a specific or to anyone using the connect
command.

example:

iLander still uses ncat to connect to clients, but will be
changed soon!
